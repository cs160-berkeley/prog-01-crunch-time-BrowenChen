Basic calorie calcation android app. Enter your numeric data, select reps or minutes as the metric, and select your activity. Displays the calories burned if the correct combination (metric - activity) is used, and displays the equivalent effort from other activities needed to be done to achieve the same level of calories burned.

Simply input a numeric value (words are not accepted), and select "Reps" or "Minutes" as your metric of measurement. Ensure that activity and metric type match up, (pushups + reps, jogging + minutes) for a correct calculation to appear.

Select the activity and hit the calculate button. Your results will show up in the two text fields below the button.
